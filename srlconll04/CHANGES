CHANGES -- CoNLL-2004 Shared Task Official Release (20040518)

#-----------------------------------------------------------

With respect to 20040301 release:

  * The correct props for the test are now included in the release.


#-----------------------------------------------------------

With respect to 20040212 release:

  * The test set has been included in the release, distributed into
    four separate files: words, synt, ne and targets. 


  * Arguments of type "AM" (without extra label) have been removed
    from data. They corresponded to annotation errors, since this
    category is no longer considered in PropBank. Only 3 arguments
    were labeled as AM: 
    
    From props.train: 
	 - Prop "take": lines 184262 to 184264 (6th column) 
	 - Prop "accept": lines 199790 to 199800 (2nd column) 

    From props.dev: 
	 - Prop "catch": lines 5919 to 5924 (2nd column)


#-----------------------------------------------------------

With respect to 20040122 pre-release:

  * We have moved to a new version of PropBank, the February 2004
    PropBank release. The new release has increased coverage and
    gained consistency. A substantial number of new propositions is
    now available. This update of the data has no influence in the
    Shared Task specification. You may want to consult the CHANGES.PB
    file included in this release, reporting changes of PropBank from
    the previous version to the current one. 


#-----------------------------------------------------------

With respect to 20040115 pre-release:

  * A few props which were wrong have been removed from data:
    From props.train : 
        - view at line 11599
        - begin at line 18623
        - give at line 32599
        - lend at line 113243  
        - conserve at line 124444  
    From props.dev : 
        - dare at line 31823
        - position at line 36660

    The "senses" files have consequently been updated, removing the
    verb sense of each verb removed. 


  * A few contiguous phrases were formatted as discontiguous with C tags.
    Such phrases have been joined. The list of phrases is 
    In props.train : 
        - use at line 2331 : A2 had 4 phrases, now 3
        - view at line 40289 : AM-MNR had 2 phrases, now 1
        - spend at line 73709 : A3 had 2 phrases, now 1
        - say at line 170617 : A1 had 2 phrases, now 1
    In props.dev : 
        - retire at line 22552 : A1 had 2 phrases, now 1 
        - watch at line 23161 : A1 had 2 phrases, now 1 
        - assert at line 30147 : A1 had 2 phrases, now 1 

#-----------------------------------------------------------

With respect to 20031223 pre-release: 

  * Verb senses are excluded from the input (they were given in column
    #6, together with target verbs). Now the verb senses are provided
    as an official resource --they correspond to manually annotated
    tags. Verbs senses will only be provided for train and development
    sets, not for the test set. 

  * Two types of argument have different labels:
     Verb realizations are now labeled "V" (they were as "R").
     Referencing arguments are now labeled as "R-" (they were as "L-"). 

  * There is a substantial number of new propositions in the data,
    including props which have non-disambiguated verb, props containing
    references, and props which realize many times an argument through
    coordination.
